## The Challenge

David's firm handles high-volume personal injury cases: motor vehicle accidents, slip-and-falls, workplace injuries. The leads never stop. But his team does.

Between 6 PM and 8 AM, every inbound call hit voicemail. On weekends, the same story. The firm was running Google Ads around the clock, paying for clicks that converted into... nothing. A ringing phone that nobody picked up.

The numbers were painful. Internal tracking showed that **over 60% of new PI inquiries came in outside business hours**. Of those, fewer than 1 in 5 left a voicemail. The rest called a competitor.

David tried an answering service. It helped with basic message-taking, but the operators couldn't qualify leads, ask about accident details, or book consultations. Callers felt like they were talking to a script, because they were.

## The Solution

Kenstera deployed a conversational AI intake agent trained specifically for personal injury workflows. The setup took less than a week.

Here's what the AI handles on every after-hours call:

- **Empathetic greeting:** acknowledges the caller's situation without sounding robotic
- **Accident screening:** asks about incident type, date, injuries, and medical treatment
- **Statute of limitations check:** flags cases that need urgent attorney review
- **Conflict check:** runs through basic questions to avoid obvious conflicts
- **Consultation booking:** offers available slots and confirms appointments directly on the firm's calendar
- **SMS follow-up:** sends the caller a confirmation text with appointment details and the firm's address

Every qualified lead lands in the firm's CRM with a full intake summary before the first attorney arrives in the morning.

The AI doesn't try to give legal advice. It doesn't pretend to be a lawyer. It does exactly what a well-trained intake coordinator does: listen, gather information, and get the right people connected.

## The Results

Within the first 30 days, the firm saw measurable changes across every intake metric that mattered.

**Missed-call rate dropped by 83%.** The only calls that go unanswered now are the ones that disconnect before the AI picks up (under 2 seconds average answer time).

**Booking rate hit 55.7%.** More than half of all after-hours callers now have a consultation on the calendar before they hang up. Previously, fewer than 10% of after-hours inquiries converted to appointments.

**Signed cases more than doubled.** With a steady pipeline of pre-qualified, pre-booked consultations, the attorneys spend their mornings in meetings with real prospects instead of chasing cold callbacks.

The front desk team noticed the difference immediately. Instead of arriving to a stack of voicemails, most from numbers that no longer pick up, they start the day with confirmed appointments and complete intake forms.

### What the data looks like

| Metric | Before Kenstera | After Kenstera |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| After-hours answer rate | 0% (voicemail) | 98.4% |
| Voicemails per week | 35–40 | 3–5 |
| After-hours bookings/week | 2–3 (callbacks) | 18–22 |
| Avg. time to first contact | 14+ hours | Under 2 seconds |
| Monthly signed cases | 12 | 26 |

## Looking Ahead

David's firm is now expanding the AI agent to handle daytime overflow calls, the ones that come in when the front desk is already on another line. They're also testing a Spanish-language intake flow for a growing segment of their client base.

The firm hasn't added headcount. They haven't extended office hours. They just stopped losing the leads they were already paying to generate.
