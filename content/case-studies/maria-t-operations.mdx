## The Challenge

Maria manages operations for a mid-size personal injury firm with three attorneys and a marketing budget that runs well into six figures annually. The firm spends heavily on Google Ads, LSAs, and a handful of referral partnerships.

The pipeline looked healthy on paper. Plenty of calls, plenty of form submissions. But the conversion math told a different story.

**Cost-per-signed-case was climbing quarter over quarter.** When Maria audited the numbers, the pattern was clear: the firm's highest-spend ad hours (evenings and weekends) had the worst conversion rates. Not because the leads were bad, but because nobody was there to answer them.

The intake team worked 8 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday. Accident calls peak between 6 PM and 10 PM, and again on Saturday mornings. Every call that hit voicemail during those windows was ad spend going to waste.

Maria had tried two answering services. Both followed the same model: a live operator takes a message, emails it to the firm, and someone calls back the next business day. By then, the prospect had already retained another attorney.

The firm was paying to generate leads it couldn't convert. The math was simple. The fix wasn't, until they stopped thinking about it as a staffing problem.

## The Solution

Kenstera's AI intake agent was configured to handle the firm's specific qualification criteria. Not generic message-taking, but actual lead qualification against the same checklist the intake team uses during business hours.

The AI evaluates every after-hours caller on:

- **Case type fit:** is this a practice area the firm handles?
- **Incident recency:** did this happen within the statute of limitations window?
- **Injury severity:** has the caller received medical treatment?
- **Liability indicators:** basic questions about fault and circumstances
- **Geographic fit:** is the incident in a jurisdiction the firm covers?

Qualified leads get booked into consultation slots immediately. The AI accesses the firm's real calendar availability and confirms the appointment on the spot. Unqualified leads receive a polite explanation and, where appropriate, a referral suggestion.

Every interaction produces a structured intake summary, not a vague message slip. The summary includes caller responses, qualification score, and a flag for any urgency factors (hospitalized caller, very recent accident, commercial vehicle involvement).

The integration took four days from kickoff to live calls. Maria's team didn't need to change their CRM, their calendar system, or their intake workflow. The AI plugs into what already exists.

## The Results

The impact showed up in the budget within the first billing cycle.

**Cost-per-signed-case dropped 40%.** The firm didn't cut ad spend. They didn't change targeting. They just started converting the leads they were already paying for, especially the ones that came in after 6 PM.

**Weekend conversions tripled.** Saturday and Sunday had been the firm's weakest conversion days despite strong call volume. With the AI handling qualification and booking, weekend leads now convert at rates comparable to Tuesday mornings.

**The intake team's workload shifted.** Instead of spending the first two hours of every Monday returning voicemails (most of which had gone cold), the team starts with pre-qualified appointments already on the calendar. They focus on case preparation instead of cold callbacks.

### Before and after

| Metric | Before Kenstera | After Kenstera |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Cost-per-signed-case | $3,200 | $1,920 |
| Weekend conversion rate | 4.1% | 13.2% |
| After-hours leads qualified | 0% (message only) | 100% |
| Monday morning voicemails | 25–30 | 2–4 |
| Avg. speed to qualification | 16 hours | 90 seconds |

**Marketing ROI improved without touching the ad budget.** The same spend now produces more signed cases because fewer leads fall through the cracks during off-hours.

## Looking Ahead

Maria is rolling the AI into daytime hours as a first-touch qualifier. Every call gets screened by the AI before reaching the intake team. This lets the human team focus exclusively on high-value consultations and complex case discussions.

The firm is also exploring automated follow-up sequences for leads that don't book immediately. The AI captures enough information on the first call to personalize a follow-up SMS or email within minutes, not days.

The takeaway from Maria's perspective: the problem was never lead volume. It was lead responsiveness. Fix the response gap and the rest of the funnel corrects itself.
